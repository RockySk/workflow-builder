        $comment: CNS is a required component to run HADDOCK. Ideally it should have
          been configured during installation. If not you can specify with the cns_exec

          to limit the load on the queueing system and also make sure jobs remain
          in the queue for some time (if concat > 1) to avoid high system loads on
          the batch system.

          script. In that way jobs might run longer in the batch system and reduce
          the load on the scheduler.

        $comment: If set to true (default) this will cause the random removal of ambiguous
          restraints for each model generated. The fraction of restraints randomly
          removed depends on the npart parameter which defines in how many sets the
          restraints should be randomly split. The first set will be removed. The
          fraction of randomly removed ambiguous restraints is thus 1/npart.

        title: Center of mass restraints
        description: Automatically defines distance restraints between the geometric
          center of the various molecules.
        $comment: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of
          mass restraints between the various molecules. This allows HADDOCK to operate
          in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints
          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance
          is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see
          cmtight description).

          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.

        title: Keep or remove non-polar hydrogen atoms
        description: If set to true, non-polar hydrogen atoms will be discarded to
          save computing time
        $comment: Since HADDOCK uses a united atom force field, the non-polar hydrogen
          atoms can be in principle discarded. This saves computing time. However
          this should not be done if you are defining distance restraints to specific
          hydrogen atoms (e.g. when using NMR distance restraints).

        $comment: When turned on, this option will automatically define center of
          mass restraints between the various molecules. This allows HADDOCK to operate
          in ab-initio mode in the absence of any other restraints. But those restraints
          can also be combined with other restraints to ensure more compact solutions.
          The distance restraints are defined between the geometrical centers of the
          various molecules (calculated on CA atoms for proteins (BB in case of Martini
          coarse-grained molecules) and N1 atoms for nucleic acids. For small ligands,
          all atoms will be used to define the geometric center. The upper limit distance
          is automatically calculated based on the dimension of the molecules (see
          cmtight description).

          distance restraints.
        $comment: This parameter controls how the upper limit distance is defined
          for the center of mass restraints between molecules. Each molecule is oriented
          along its principle components and the x,y and z dimensions are calculated.
          If cmtight=true, the molecule distance (size) is set to the average of its
          smallest two half dimensions. If cmtight=false, the molecule distance (size)
          is set to the average of its three half dimensions.. In case of DNA or small
          ligands the molecule distance (size) is set to 0. The effective upper distance
          limit for the center or mass distance restraint is the sum of the two molecule
          distances.
